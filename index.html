<p>This Wiki presents a working Pattern Language for Sustainable Organisations, developed in the context of Wales’ <a href="http://www.sd-charter.net/">SD Charter</a> by A Sustainable Place CIC with Cynnal Cymru and the Institute for Sustainable Design (ISD) at University of Wales Trinity St. David (UWTSD).</p>

<p>A Pattern Language is a practical tool for recording, communicating and supporting best practice in a field. The Patterns and the links between them present knowledge about replicable solutions to recurring challenges in the context of developing and running sustainable organisations in Wales (although many are more generally relevant to the subject of sustainable organisations). </p>

<p>The Pattern Language can be used as a tool to help organisations think about, develop and communicate their engagement with sustainability. Together and in combination the patterns provide a systemic picture or framework that can help organisations consider the many elements and factors relevant to sustainability. This framework is not definitive or complete – it is a shared picture emerging from the collective knowledge, expertise and experience of SD Charter signatories and other organisations working on sustainability in Wales. </p>

<p>The Pattern Language is open source and open ended.
It is free to be copied and used – and applied to your own organisation, sector or project.
Contributions are also welcome – please contact us with any suggestions for amendments or additions; to share your learning in this field; and to share the results of any practical application you have made of the patterns.</p>

<p>The patterns presented have been identified by thematic analysis of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evidence and information recorded from participants during four workshops with SD Charter signatory organisations and other organisations and individuals interested in sustainability.<br>
</li>
<li>Evidence gathered from reports and case studies including: INSPIRE (Institute of Sustainable Practice, Innovation and Resource Effectiveness, within UWTSD) case study material; Natural Resources Wales (NRW) Corporate Plan; Vale of Glamorgan Corporate Plan; Case studies of SD Charter signatory organisations (Coed Lleol’s Actif Woods Wales programme; Radyr &amp; Morganstown Community Council; Datblygiadau Egni Gwledig (DEG) social enterprise; Antur Waunfawr social enterprise; FareShare Cymru and The Rural Regeneration Unit social enterprise).<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The patterns presented represent elements relevant to sustainable organisations, as emerging from the above evidence. </p>

<p>The thematic analysis of this material led to the identification of over 100 emerging patterns. From these we have further identified 21 higher level ‘pattern sets’ that the 100+ patterns can be grouped under. This presentation is not definitive, but provides one way of organising the breadth of evidence that we have identified. </p>

<p>Users can start at any point with a pattern relevant to their current interest or need, and then follow linkages to other related patterns. However, it is recommended that you start at the top level (0) to get a more systemic picture. A <strong>map of the patterns</strong> is available to help visualise and navigate the systemic framework.</p>
